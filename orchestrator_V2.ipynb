    "About Us GSR is crypto’s capital markets partner, helping founders and institutions scale with confidence. With over a decade of specialized expertise, we deliver institutional-grade market making, OTC trading, and strategic venture capital to support growth at every stage. Our value goes beyond execution. We provide access to liquidity, real-time market intelligence, and strategic guidance shaped by years operating at the center of global crypto markets. We bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, connecting teams with the capital, market access, and insights they need to build what’s next.   About the Role As a Quant Trader, you will be at the forefront of creating innovative models and algorithms in the dynamic world of digital assets. Your work will involve generating insights into cryptocurrency market behaviour and developing state-of-the-art automated trading algorithms. You may analyse market microstructure to enhance existing algorithm performance, design or develop advanced computing architectures, and implement new trading strategies. Your contributions will help solve complex business problems using quantitative and technological techniques. Specific responsibilities could include:\n",

      "At BAM, I built an end-to-end ML pipeline for defect detection in safety-critical applications—owning the full loop from raw thermal imaging data through preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and production deployment. I defined labeling heuristics, designed synthetic augmentation to stress-test edge cases, automated GPU training runs, and ran rigorous cross-validation to quantify model stability. Working with noisy, high-dimensional time series data taught me to extract meaningful patterns where signal-to-noise ratios are unforgiving. I'm applying for the Quant Trader role because this work centers on what I do best: turning complex data into measurable, deployable algorithmic decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "My technical foundation spans Python-based data processing, PyTorch deep learning architectures, and ensemble methods including Random Forests and XGBoost. My master's thesis involved building Monte Carlo simulation frameworks and implementing weak signal extraction techniques—work that developed my instinct for probing sensitivity, isolating performance drivers, and avoiding overfitting to convenient conditions. I approach problems through disciplined experimentation: controlled perturbations, systematic validation, and honest assessment of failure modes. This research methodology fits the iterative cycle of hypothesis generation, backtesting, and performance attribution that quantitative trading demands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crypto trading appeals to me for the density of data, rapid feedback loops, and clarity of success metrics. I'm drawn to GSR's position at the intersection of institutional finance and digital assets, where algorithmic sophistication and novel pattern recognition create genuine competitive advantage. I'm motivated by environments where models face continuous judgment and improvements compound through careful measurement. I learn fast, work independently, and take ownership of problems from research through implementation. I'd welcome the opportunity to contribute my skills in statistical modeling and algorithm development to GSR's trading operations.\n",

      "My name is Anton Averin, and I would like to be a Quant Trader at GSR. In my current role at BAM, I built an end-to-end ML pipeline for defect detection in safety-critical thermography data, owning the full loop from raw thermal time series through preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment. I defined labeling heuristics, designed targeted synthetic augmentation to stress-test edge cases, automated GPU training runs, and ran rigorous cross-validation to quantify stability under distribution shift. This work required extracting weak, actionable structure from noisy, high-dimensional sequences and turning it into a reliable, measurable decision system.\n",
      "\n",
      "A key point is that both my current project and my master’s thesis were executed largely independently: I scoped the problem, designed the experiments, implemented the tooling, and drove results without needing constant direction. I am a strong self-researcher and I’m comfortable taking complex, ambiguous tasks from “no pipeline/no baseline” to a working system. My technical foundation is Python-centric and includes PyTorch deep learning, classical ML (including Random Forests and XGBoost), careful feature design for time series, and disciplined validation practices. In my thesis, I built Monte Carlo simulation frameworks and weak-signal extraction methods, which trained my instinct for sensitivity analysis, isolating performance drivers, and avoiding overfitting through controlled experimentation.\n",

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute as an independent researcher who can develop, test, and implement data-driven trading ideas end-to-end.\n",
